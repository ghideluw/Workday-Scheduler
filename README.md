daily workday schedule organizer for event using jQuery
# Daily-Work-Task-Scheduler
Application used to schedule in tasks for the workday during working hours (09:00 - 17:00)
This application is used to create a daily workday scheduler to organize your day in chronological order from the beginning of the workday (09:00AM) to the end 
(17:00PM). The application utilises local storage to save details of the task for each hour time block. The items in each time category can be edited to factor 
in changes in the day. The application also implements color coding of present, current, and future tasks for better visualisation of daily progression and organisation. The application can be updated for each new work day and is an effective organization tool for your work day.
